I have read the CSE departmentâ€™s anti-cheating policy available at https://www.cse.iitk.ac.in/pages/AntiCheatingPolicy.html. I understand that plagiarism is a severe offense. I have solved this assignment myself without indulging in any plagiarism. If my submission is found to be plagiarized from the internet, fellow students, etc., then strict action can be taken against me. <Shourya Trikha and 210994>

I have used man pages, Operating system in 3 easy pieces book and lecture slides for reference during the assignemnt.
